**Steps to be performed:**

- You should select a minimum of one security mechanism from each  of the security requirements from authentication and authorization ( auditing  is not included here).

- The auditing requirements should be considered as suggested  in the table according to your application. Other than the normal check on  protecting log files, backup files, etc, you should also think about the GDPR obligations, software licensing, etc.  in line with your application.

- The given security mechanisms are for your inspiration. You  can select other mechanisms also according to the requirement of your  application. For example: If you select "authentication" as one  of the security requirements, the mechanism can be logging/password  checking, biometric, OAuth, etc. The same is applicable for authorization and  auditing.

- Justify the reason to select a particular mechanism for the requirements in  the given column ‘C’.

- Write supplement requirement(s) in the form of a user story or  Abuse case for the application (refer to the example given on the table, column ‘D’).  (The supplement requirements should be according to the goals and  non-functional requirement (s) identified for your application.)

- Write the possible risks involved for the supplement requirements (refer to  the example given in the table, column ‘E’).

- Write the resources/mechanisms/tools to avoid/mitigate those risks for  security controls (refer to the example of the column heading "Appropriate  Security Control" (column ‘F’))

- This document must be reviewed with the team members and approved by your  mentor(s)/TAs.

- Put  checkmark in the last column for all verified items.

- This  document should be appended to the Software Requirement Specification (SRS)  document.

  **Follow  these 5 points for each of the Security Mechanisms and write them under  Appropriate Security Controls**:

  (i) Supplement security requirements to avoid risk. 
  
  (ii) Write the requirement of the resources to mitigate such risks. For example:  The type of Authentication software, security tokens, password management  software, etc.
  
  (iii) Devise a plan/method (tentative) to work on the identified risks.
  
  (iv)  Review the documentation within your team.
  
  (v)  Approve the document by your mentor.

| ------------------ | -------------- |
| **Team  members:** | **Mentor(s):** |

**Instructions:**

1. Refer to the below table. All the mentioned points are mandatory to perform for your application except point no. 4.

2. You should consider at least 2 vulnerabilities for each  criteria given in Column 'B', except point no. 4, 6, and 7.

3. The mitigation plan/solution should be considered for every  identified vulnerability. 

4. Make sure to review the document with your team members and mentor(s) before final submission.

5. This checklist should be in lined and submitted along with the Software Testing document.
